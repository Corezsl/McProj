# Minecraft AI Project (McProj)

An experimental project focused on building an **intelligent Minecraft AI agent** capable of **understanding player commands, interacting naturally via language**, and eventually **learning through reinforcement learning**.



## Overview

This project aims to explore the intersection of **large language models (LLMs)**, **game agents**, and **reinforcement learning** within the Minecraft environment.

The long-term vision is an AI companion that can:
- Understand natural language instructions
- Interact meaningfully with the player
- Act autonomously within the Minecraft world
- Learn and improve through experience

## Project Goals

- Create a Minecraft AI agent that can *follow player commands*
- Enable natural language interaction using LLM API calls
- Integrate the AI directly into a live Minecraft environment
- Lay the groundwork for reinforcement learning using MineRL
- Explore emergent behaviour and decision-making in a complex sandbox world

---

## Core Ideas

### Language-Based Interaction
- Player communicates with the AI using natural language
- Commands and conversations are processed via LLM calls
- The AI responds both in text and through in-game actions

### Agent Behaviour
- The AI observes the Minecraft world state
- Translates high-level instructions into actionable steps
- Maintains contextual awareness of the player and environment

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Minecraft Java Edition**
- **LLM APIs** (for command understanding & dialogue)
- **MineRL** (planned – reinforcement learning environment)
- **Gym-style environments** (future integration)

---

## Planned Architecture (High-Level)

1. **Player Input**
   - Natural language command or query

2. **LLM Processing**
   - Intent extraction
   - Task decomposition
   - Dialogue generation

3. **Action Layer**
   - Minecraft-compatible actions
   - World interaction & movement

4. **Feedback Loop**
   - Observe environment changes
   - Update internal state / memory

5. **Learning Layer (Future)**
   - Reinforcement learning via MineRL
   - Policy optimisation from experience

---

## Future Work

-  Basic command parsing & execution
-  Persistent memory and context tracking
-  Multi-step task planning
-  Reinforcement learning with MineRL
-  Skill acquisition (mining, crafting, combat, building)
-  Long-term autonomous behaviour

---

## Why Minecraft?

Minecraft provides:
- An accessible, open-ended environment
- Complex but learnable mechanics
- Strong existing research support
- A perfect sandbox for testing intelligent agents

---

## Inspiration & Related Work

- MineRL Competition
- OpenAI Minecraft research
- Autonomous agent research in simulated environments
- LLM-based planning and tool use
